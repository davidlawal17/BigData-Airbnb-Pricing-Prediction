# BigData-Airbnb-Pricing-Prediction
Predictive modelling and clustering analysis of London Airbnb data using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn


This repository contains my coursework for **CO3093: Big Data & Predictive Analytics** at the University of Leicester.  
The project applies **data cleaning**, **predictive modelling**, and **K-Means clustering** techniques to analyse Airbnb listings in London.

## üìò Project Overview

The aim of this project is to explore and model Airbnb property prices using machine learning methods.  
Key objectives include:
- Cleaning and transforming the Airbnb dataset  
- Building regression models to predict nightly prices  
- Applying **K-Means clustering** to group similar listings  
- Comparing model performance across clusters and global models
